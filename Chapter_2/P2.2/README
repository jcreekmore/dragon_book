* Problem Statement
  Modify the translator in Section 2.9 to produce as output code for
  the abstract stack machine of Section 2.8.

* Abstract Stack Machine code

** Stack Manipulation
   | Instruction | Description                                                                  |
   |-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | push /v/    | push /v/ onto the stack                                                      |
   | rvalue /l/  | push contents of data location /l/                                           |
   | lvalue /l/  | push address of data location /l/                                            |
   | pop         | throw away value of top of the stack                                         |
   | :=          | the /r/-value on top is placed in the /l/-value below it and both are popped |
   | copy        | push a copy of the top value on the stack                                    |

** Control Flow
   | Instruction | Description                                             |
   |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
   | label /l/   | target of jumps to /l/; has no other affect             |
   | goto /l/    | next instruction is taken from statement with label /l/ |
   | gofalse /l/ | pop the top value; jump if it is zero                   |
   | gotrue /l/  | pop the top value; jump if it is nonzero                |
   | halt        | stop execution                                          |
